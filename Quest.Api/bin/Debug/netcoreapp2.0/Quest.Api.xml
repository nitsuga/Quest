            "iss" (Issuer) Claim
            </summary>
            <remarks>The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the
              JWT.  The processing of this claim is generally application specific.
              The "iss" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
              value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.</remarks>

            "aud" (Audience) Claim
            </summary>
            <remarks>The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is
              intended for.  Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST
              identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal
              processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the
              "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be
              rejected.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of case-
              sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value.  In the
              special case when the JWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a
              single case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.  The
              interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.
              Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.</remarks>
